![build status](https://github.com/praisetompane/language/actions/workflows/language.yaml/badge.svg) <br>

## Objectives
- An in-depth study of:
    - Language's Compiler/Interpreter.
        - This focuses on:
            - []()
            - [Annotations on the actual interpreter implementation]()
    - Language's language design, implementation and ecosystem.

## Language Details
- [Language Specification]
    - the syntax and semantics description
    - key topics:
        - implementations
        - lexical analysis
        - data model
        - standard type hierarchy
        - execution model
- [Compiler | Interpreter]()
- [Type System]()
- [Memory Model]()
- [Language Reference]()
- [Standard Library]()
    - commonly used and required features of a language
        e.g. collections
- Packaging and Distribution
    - [Core Module Index]()
    - [Package Index]()
    - Tools:
        - ...
    - Structuring Projects:
        - ...
- [Extending and Embedding]()
- [Developer Contribution Guide]
- [History]

## Use Cases
- [Applications for Language]()
- [Effective Application]
    - The style of effective programs, with emphasis on idioms.      
    - Metaphors, images, and ways of thinking favoured by the language.
