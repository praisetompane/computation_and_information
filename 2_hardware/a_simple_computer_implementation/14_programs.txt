def program (Scott, 2009:71):
    a sequence of instructions.

    types (Scott, 2009:71):
        - application
        - operating system

        - application:
            program used to 𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑙𝑦
                the computer to a specific problem.

        - operating system
            program used:
                - to manage the computer.
                - assist the application programs.

    based on the size, programs tend to be given different names(Scott, 2009:71):
        system: collection of programs solving a problem.
        program: a single sequence of instructions solving a problem.
        routine: a sequence of instructions solving a subset of problem.
        subroutine: a sequence of instructions solving a subset of a routine.

        NB: These are not precise definitions.
            The general name for all these is Program.
