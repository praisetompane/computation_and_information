def computer languages(programming languages):
    a shorthand for Instruction Code (Scott, 2009:113).
        NB: this shorthand is itself a code.
            MYINC: I think the use of phrases below, even though most high level are English-like is a result of this:
                    - code repository
                    - coding a program
                    - ...

    a way to represent Instruction Code in close to human natural language.

    purpose: make it easier to write computer programs (Scott, 2009:113).

    usage flow (Scott, 2009:113):
        - write program in computer language in ASCII/UT-* and save to file.                         => code.txt
        - load compiler (a separate program) into RAM.
        - load code.txt into RAM.
        - point compiler to code.txt in RAM.
        - JUMP to compiler first instruction:
            - compiler loads code.txt
            - translates each line in code.txt
                to corresponding Instruction Code bytes (i.e. 8 bits for the Instruction Register).    
                MYINC:  All files in a computer are really computer programs(sequence of Instruction Code bytes)
                            including your word files, text, etc; 
                                they are ASCII/UT-* programs for LibreWord or Microsoft Office or Notepad compilers (so to speak).
                                
        - saves translation to a separate file.                                                      => program

        at arbitrary later time you can:
            - load program file into RAM.
            - CPU will JUMP to its first instruction
                and execute the rest.
            - if correctly written (i.e. in code.txt) AND correctly compiled (i.e. into program) then
                it will do what you intended.

        NB: the file names code.txt and program can be anything you want.
