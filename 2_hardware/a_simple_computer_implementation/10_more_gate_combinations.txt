1. AND GATE chain to require n inputs to be on to have an on output (Scott, 2009:26)
    where n > 2

2. decoder GATE combination (Scott, 2009:29)

    bit configured to turn on a specific AND gate for a specific combination of inputs i1 and i2...in
        n = number of inputs

    Considering the four possible states of the input as a 'code'
        The output (AND gate that is on) tells you which of the 'codes' is currently on the input
            4 outputs, each correspond to the four possible input states

            code => AND gate on

    It's a sort of mapper, hence the name decoder?
    You know given that the AND gate 0/0 is on that you had the input a=0, and b=0 (ion a 2X3 decoder)
    name convention INPUTS X OUTPUTS (2X4){2 inputs and 4 outputs}

    only one output is ALWAYS 'on' based on the state of the inputs
