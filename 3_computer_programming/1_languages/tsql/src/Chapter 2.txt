Note: T-SQL uses three valued predicate logic

Logical Order of Query processing:
	The computer stars with the location: FROM
	Performs any filtering(Predicates): WHERE
	Gets the stuff you want
	Sorts the results(ordering)[Merely for presentatiom, order does not matter in SSet Theory]

	FROM
	WHERE
	GROUP BY
	HAVING
	SELECT
	ORDER BY

FROM
	Always specify schema of you have them, makes code faster

GROUP BY
	Creates a group for each unique combination of elements sent to it

	Note: All other clauses subsequent to GROUP BY must operate on Groups
		The rest of the columns can only used by Aggregate functions



SYNTAX NOTES

	YEAR(orderDate) as OrderYear: The OrderYear is merely for presentation, its not an actual column

	SELECT empID, YEAR(OrderDate) as OrderYear, SUM(FREIGHT) as TotalFreight,COUNT(*) as NumberOfOrders
	FROM Sales.Orders
	WHERE custid = 71
	GROUP BY empID, YEAR(OrderDate);
	
	COUNT(*) will return the number of rows in each group
	SUM(FREIGHT) will return the sum of all freight values in the group
	
	NB: All aggregate functions ignore nulls
