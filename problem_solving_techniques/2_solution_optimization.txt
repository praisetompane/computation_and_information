Your key weapon: Hash table (Mcdowell, 2015)

Standard Asymptotic Complexities:
    - 𝑂(1)
    - 𝑂(𝑙𝑜𝑔ₙ)
    - 𝑂(𝑁)
    - 𝑂(𝑁𝑙𝑜𝑔ₙ)
    - 𝑂(𝑁²)
    - 𝑂(𝑁³)
    - (2ⁿ)

    - O(1): no optimization needed
    
    - O(N²):
        How do you explore n² combinations in N time(i.e. in one iteration = 𝑂(𝑁))?

            1. Change from:
                    iterating(exploring) with an index
                        using the index to extract a value
                        and doing some work
                TO
                    iterating(exploring) with a value
                        using the value to do the work
                            if it is a valid value in your universe(i.e. data structure)
                SO
                    once you have a value
                    you can ask your Iterable => Do you have this value?

            Example
                Given 
                    numbers = [2,9,4,7]
                Objective
                    find possible pair that generates a sum (T)

                Then: iterating(exploring) with an index looks like this:
                    for i to length of numbers                        : iterating(exploring) with index
                        for j = i + 1 to length of numbers       : iterating(exploring) with index
                            if numbers at i + numbers at j == T     : using the index to extract a value
                                return numbers at i and j        : and doing some work
                    ∴ O(N²)

                Then: iterating(exploring) with a value
                    for i to length of numbers   
                        create a map where
                            the key is the value
                            {key -> value} : key = value, value = arbitrary data(maybe the index)

                            {
                                2 -> 0
                                9 -> 1
                                4 -> 2
                                7 -> 3 
                            }
                    for i  to length of numbers 
                        other addend = T - numbers at i 
                        if other addend is in map
                            return other addend's value in map(i.e. index) and i
                    
                    ∴ 𝑂(𝑁) + 𝑂(𝑁) => O(N2) => 𝑂(𝑁)
                        the term that increases the complexity of the problem the most is N
                        ∴ discard the 2
