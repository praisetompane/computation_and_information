def: The thinking to define Computer Science as a Science

Objective: Defines what kind of things can be computed mechanically, how fast and the amount of space required to do so.
                - Defines and studies different models of computation and how efficiently they can solve problems.
                - Contains complexity theory(P versus NP problem => refer to 2_computational_complexity_and_cryptography folder)

Computation Models
    0. Finite State Machine (FSM)
    1. Context Free Language (CFL)
    2. Turing Machines
    3. Undecidable    


    0. Simplest model of computation
        Very Limited amount of memory
        Can perform ONLY very low level computations
    1. Higher level of computation above FSM
        Language in CLF = Set of strings
    2. Machine that can perform higher levels of computation beyond FSM and CFL
    3. Problems that cannot be solved mechanically
