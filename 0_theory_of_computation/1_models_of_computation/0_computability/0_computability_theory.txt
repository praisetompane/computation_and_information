def computability theory(Sipser, 2012:3):
    - formal: ???

        - in words: ???

    - plain english: 
        - theory to classify problems into the two categories below:
            - SOLVABLE by computers (i.e. Computable)
            - NOT SOLVABLE by computers (i.e. Incomputable)
        - theory that explores the capabilities and limitations of computers(i.e. computation or algorithms)

    - intuition: interested in what is computable in principle.

    - properties:
        - research timeline: 1930 - 1950

    - examples:
        - classification of problems (Sipser, 2012:2):
            - SOLVABLE
                - add two numbers 1 + 5.
                - ...
            - NOT SOLVABLE
                - prove whether a mathematical statement is True or False.
                - ...

    - use cases: ???
        
    - proof: None. It is a field.
    
    Q: Can define new models of computation that can compute the current incomputable(UNSOLVABLE) problems?
