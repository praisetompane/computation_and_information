    Wrapper/Container/Context for values
        with the following operations
            identity: Unit in Scala, return in Haskell
                
                unit[A](a: A): F[A]
            map
                Provides a way to apply a function to the values
                Returns values in same context(same container, this allows for chaining)
                fMap in Haskell, just map in Scala

                map[A, B](f:F[A])(f: A → B): F[B]

    Bit of Category Theory
        Functor is a "mapping" between categories
            hence the map function on all Functors
            The map function maps morphims
            identity maps the objects
    example
    Functor {
        values //the values
        map(g) // function f that applies function g to every item in values
    }

Functor laws
    given m is a Functor instance
        holding some value of type Int
        function f and g are single parameter functions that transform that value
            They have the signature: Int => Something

            VERY IMPORTANT: f and g are single parameter functions
                            This is a limitation, we can't even solve it with currying because the result type 
                            is the partially applied function wrapped in a Functor context(refers to Functors.scala) file

                            map does not know how to apply functions like these(Applicatives solve this problem)

        1. identity law
            map id = id //math "="
            Scala : m.map(identity) == m

            //given some value simply return that value
        2. distributive law
            F map f map g = F map (g◦f) //math "="
            Scala m.map(f).map(g) == m.map(x => g(f(x)))

            ◦ = standard mathematical notation for function composition 
                (g◦f) means g after f
            F = functor

What is a applicative(applicative functor)?
    Note: Address the problem that map does not know how to apply functions wrapped inside a Functor context
    A Functor that has multi-parameter functions to map over it's values

    has the following functions
        identity
        apply
            apply[A,B](f: F[A])(f: F[A → B]): F[B]

    other way to define an applicative functor
        identity
        map2

    other way to define an applicative functor
        identity
        map
        product
    laws
        https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Applicative_functors#Applicative_functor_laws

    When is useful?
        Suppose you read 3 points of triangle from a DB
            returned as Future[Int] (because it's IO)
        And you want to calculate the perimeter using the function below
            def calculate(a: Int, b: Int, c: Int): Int = a + b + c

            You can't use pass them in because they're Future[Int] and the function expects Int

        solution
            def calculate(a: Int)(b: Int)(c: Int): Int = a + b + c // must be curried

        val a = Future(2)
        val b = Future(6)
        val c = Future(4)

        a.apply(b.apply(c.apply(unit(calculate))))

        Note: calculate is wrapped in unit, because apply operates on functions wrapped in a Functor context

What is a monad?
    resources: https://medium.com/@sinisalouc/demystifying-the-monad-in-scala-cc716bb6f534
    Wrapper/Container/Context for values 
        with the following operations
            1. identity (return in Haskell, unit in Scala)
            2. bind/flatMap (>>= in Haskell, flatMap in Scala)

            1. performs the wrapping part

What are the monad axioms?
    Context: given some value x, monad instance m(with a value), functions f and g of type Int -> M[Int]

    1. left identity law
    2. right identity law
    3. associativty law

    1. unit(x).flatMap(f) == f(x)
    2. m.flatMap(unit) == m
    3. m.flatMap(f).flatMap(g) == m.flatMap(x => f(x).flatMap(g))

What Scala data types are, or behave like, monads?
    Option
    List
    Seq
    All of them?
    No, Ints etc

What are the basic and optional requirement/s to conform a Monad?
    unit
    flatMap

Explain higher order functions.
    functions that at least take function parameters or return functions

What is gained from using immutable objects?
    equality is reliable
    code is predictable and reliably deterministic

    copy data structures when "chaining"
        slow? No => persistent/partially persistent immutable datastructure
            structural sharing

    control state
    avoid concurrent state access issues
        dirty reads
        unrepeatable reads

What is tail recursion?
    Resource: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tail-recursion/
    This is a special case of recursion
    where the last statement executed is the call to the function

    Why do we care?
        Save stack space
        Compilers can optimize tail recursive calls as opposed to non tail recursive calls
        How:
            function call stack elimination
            Since the last statement in the call to the function, thus
                there is nothing else left to do.
                We can discard the current function call's stack allocation

How does it differentiate from common recursion?
    common recusrion creates a new stack frame for each function invocation

    while tail recursion, does not. It runs in constant stack space
    compilers do this by using a technique called tail call optimization
        identity tail recursion
        label the beginning
        update parameters at the end
        execute a goto start

What issues are there with tail recursive functions in the JVM?
    The instruction set available on the JVM makes implementing more advanced tail recusrion very difficult
    
    Only direct tail recursive calls to the same function can be optimized

    Example of ones that can't
        1. mutually tail recursive calls
            def isEven(n: Int) if (n % 2 == 0) true else isOdd(n)
            def isOdd(n: Int) if (n % 2 != 0) true else isEven(n)
        2. if the tail call is nested in a function value
            { functionCall(n) }

How does the Scala compiler optimize a tail recursive function?
    same way described here: How does it differentiate from common recursion?

How do you ensure that the compiler optimizes the tail recursive function?
    @tailrec

What is function currying?  
    Taking a function of n parameters
        and turning it into n single parameter functions

    def f(x: Int)(y: Int)(z: Int) = x + y + z

    f(1) returns g(y: Int)(z: Int) = 1 + y + z
    g(5) returns h(z: Int) = 1 + 5 + z
    h(10) returns 16 // 1 + 5 + 10

What are implicit parameters?
    parameters passed in implicitiy
    thye're marked with implicit on definition

What are typeclasses?
    Resource: https://blog.scalac.io/2017/04/19/typeclasses-in-scala.html
    Read this AS WELL!!: https://medium.com/@sinisalouc/ad-hoc-polymorphism-and-type-classes-442ae22e5342
    A Type class is a class(group) of types
        Which satisfy some contract (They're not necessarily in the same class hierarchy)
            defined somewhere(maybe in a trait in Scala)
            with condition that such functionality(trait and implementation) can be added wihtout changing the original code
    Note: You can do this with a trait, how are type classes better?
        You do not need to change the declaration of the existing type
        With a trait mixin you have to go and mix the trait into the type you want to add this behaviour to
            effectively changing and code and need to recompile...



    Usecase: Want to add some behavior to classes that are not in some natural class hierarchy
            Construct to add adhoc polymorphism by creating a grouping of objects?
        What is polymorphism? => refer to OOP file
