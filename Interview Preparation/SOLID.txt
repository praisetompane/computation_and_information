Single Responsibility:
    Software components(classes/functions/modules) should be responsible for only one thing

    Examples: Payments platform
        Imagine we had 
            class Transaction(feeData, paymentData)
                +calculateFee
                +transferPayment

        PROB: This class is responsible for two things FEES and PAYMENTS
        ISSUE: When changing FEES related functionality you need to regression test PAYMENTS
            because you MIGHT have broken features in there

        SOLUTION:
            class Payment
                +transferPayment

            class Fee
                +calculateFee

            class Transaction(fee: Fee, payment: Payment)

            Delegate to these classes where you need their functionality

            Benefit:
                Independent testing
                Change one without definitely affecting the other
                Reusabiluuy, Fee and Payment can be used in other places in the code base

Open Closed Principle
    Software components(classes/functions) should be OPEN for EXTENSION
    but CLOSED for modification.

    By  Bertrand Mayer

    You should not need to modify existing code to add new features. New features
    should just be an extension of what is already there.

    Design your classes in a way that lends them to enhancement via subclases and inheritance.


    Example:
        class Transaction(paymentAmount, fromBankAccount, ToBankAccount, FeePercent)
            +calculateFee = FeePercent * paymentAmount
            +transferPayment

        New Requirement: Different for fee rates per transaction type
            One way to do this:
                - add transactionType class parameter

            class Transaction(paymentAmount, fromBankAccount, ToBankAccount, FeePercent, transactionType)
                +calculateFee = {
                    if transactionType == "XX": FeePercent * paymentAmount
                    else: SomeOtherFeePercent * paymentAmount
                }
                +transferPayment

            PROB: We're already violating Single Responsibility here


            SOLUTION
                class Payment
                    +transferPayment

                abstract  class Fee
                    +calculateFee

                class EFTFee extends Fee
                    +calculateFee //specific calculation for EFTFee

                infuture
                class ChequeDepositFee
                    +calculateFee 

            Benefit:
                No regression on existing features
                Independent testing
                Change one without definitely affecting the other
                Reusabiluuy, Fee and Payment can be used in other places in the code base


Libskov Substitution Principle
    Subclases should be substitutable for base classes and client code should not know which substype it dealing with.
    Implementation guidelines:
        subclases should NOT introduce any new exceptions
        subclases should be substitutable for base types
        This is specific type of subtyping called "strong behavioral subtyping"

        Example:
                abstract class Payment
                    +transferPayment(amount)

                abstract class Fee
                    +calculateFee

                class EFTFee extends Fee
                    +calculateFee 

                class ZapperPayment extends Payment
                    +transferPayment

                class BankToBankPayment extends Payment
                    +transferPayment : throws Exception for Zero payment

            PROB:
                subtype BankToBankPayment introduces a new exception
                We could check that the amount is not zero before pass the subtyp through, but this means the client needs to worry about 
                which subtype it is dealing( further violating LSP)

            SOLUTION
                trait ZeroPayablePayment
                    +transferPayment(amount): //do work

                trait NonZeroPayablePayment
                    +transferPayment(amount): if amount < 0 throw ZeroAmountException

                class ZapperPayment extends ZeroPayablePayment
                    +transferPayment

                class BankToBankPayment extends NonZeroPayablePayment
                    +transferPayment

            BENEFITS:
                Observes SRP and OCP
                No need to worry about which subtype you're dealing with    
                    and take full advantage of polymorphism


Interface Segration Principle
    Specific interfaces

    trait Stream
        +read
        +write
        +close

    class ReadWriteFileStream extends Stream
        +read: read file
        +write: write some data to a file
        +close: close the file

    class ReadOnlyFileStream extends Stream
        +read: read file
        +write: throw exception
        +close: close the file

    class rire OnlyFileStream extends Stream
        +read: throw exception
        +write: read file 
        +close: close the file

    PROB:
        The interfaces are too broad
        classes that only have functionality for the subset of behavior throw exceptions
        I think its poor design to have classes expose behavior they do not know how to perform
        Also client code will need to worry about which subtype of Stream they're dealing with 
            and invoke only valid behavior: THIS VIOLATES Libskov Substitution Principle

    SOLUTION
        trait ReadStream
            +read
            +close

        trait WriteStream
            +read
            +write
            +close

        class ReadOnlyFileStream extends ReadStream
            +read: read file
            +close: close the file

        class WriteOnlyStream  extends WriteStream
            +write
            +close

        class ReadWriteFileStream extends ReadStream with WriteStream
            +read: read file
            +write: write some data to a file
            +close: close the file

Dependency Inversion Principle
    High Level Modules should not depend on low level details
    Both low level details and high level modules should depend upon asbtractions

    This principle is embodied very well by the common practice of coding to interfaces

    Example:
        class RestApplication(payemntReposity:PaymentReposity)

        class PaymentReposity
            +savePayment

        PROB:
            The RestApplication depends on a low level construct called PayemntReposity for accessing the Payment Database
            This makes these two tightly coupled
                -changes in the PayemntReposity directly affect the RestApplication
                -you cannot easily swap out the repository Implementation(say you wanted to write to a mongoDB instead of SQL server)
                    -you'd have to redefine the RestApplication class
                        -either change the type for payemntReposity
                        -or add another parameter for mongoPaymentRepository

        SOLUTION
            trait Repository

            class PayemntReposity extends Respository

            class RestApplication(repository: Repository)

        BENEFITS
            Now the RestApplication is decoupled from specific repository implementations
            You can easily swap out repositories as long as they implement the contract defined by the abstract contract defined in Respository
