What is it?
    A fixed length
    contiguous allocation of memory cells
        of the same size
        that stores data of the same type

Concepts related to it:
    index = a number which indetifies a memory cell in the array

Performance Analysis:
    How fast is it to peform the operation?(i.e. Time Complexity)
        => Measured in terms of the number of steps it takes to complete the operation

          Accessing a value at a particular index (.e.g index 2) (particular spot)

        Steps = 1
        How? 
            1. The computer can directly access(jump to) any memory address
            2. The array stores the memory address of the first value
            3. Every array starts at index 0
                3.1. And the array memory address are numerically one after the other

        Example
            Given :             ["Apple", "Banana", "Pear", "Orange", "Peach"]
            memory address        1010       1011     1012    1013      1014
            index                   0          1        2       3        4

            Request:
                Read value at index 4

                Steps
                    compute and read target address = starting_address + index = 1010 + 4 = 1014


    Search: Looking for a particular value in te datastructure
            Looking to see if a value exists in the array, and if it does, returning its index in the array

        Steps = 

    Insert: Adding a value to the datastructure 
            Adding a new value to an additional index in the array
