def enabler (enable byte) (Scott, 2009:24):
    formal:

    plain english: 
        eight AND gates
            with second input of each gate
            all connected into one input 'e'(enable)

        NB: used almost every time we want to remember the state of a byte. 
    
    flow:
        e is 'off/0':
            inputs into enabler do reach output 'o'
        e is 'on/1':
            inputs into enabler reach output 'o' unchanged
