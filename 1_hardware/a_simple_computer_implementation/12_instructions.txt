def instruction register(IR) (Scott, 2009:71):
    a register that has a byte
        which tells the Control Section/Unit
            what to do.

    the byte states (i.e. the 256 possible states)
        have meaning 
            defined in the Instruction Code
                for THIS computer.
    
    the meaning of the byte states
        is implemented with the Control Unit's wiring.

    ALL instructions
        cause bytes to move across the bus.
        possible flows:
            - to or from RAM.
            - to or from registers.
            - through the ALU.

def instruction address register(IAR): TBD
