1. We can use a bit to 'represent' something else in our lives (Scott, 2009:18).

2. A code: something that tells you what something else means (Scott, 2009:18).

e.g When the bit is on turn the light red, which means stop (Scott, 2009:18).
    When the bit is off turn the light red, which means go

    When the bit is on I need the order with fries
    When the bit is off I need the order without fries 
    
Limitation, we can only represent yes or no matters right now (Scott, 2009:18).
