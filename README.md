## What is Computation?

def¹: the **transformation** of **sequences of symbols** by **precise rules**(Konrad, Computation in Science:6)

* symbols = {1,0,\*,{,;,<,>,...}
* to be refined: precise rules
  * example sequences:
    * 11010
    * ;\*>{11}  
      i.e. any sequence of the valid symbols

def²: The **evolution process** of some environment, by a **sequence of "simple, local" steps** (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy).

objective: unpack computing and its relation to mathematics in layman's terms.
