def computational_problem: a binary relation from problem inputs to correct outputs (Demaine, Ku, Solomon, 2020).
    - binary relation definition:
        see: https://github.com/praisetompane/mathematics/blob/master/0_foundations/relation.txt

computational problem types:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_problem

    Data Re/Organization:
        0. Can the incoming data structure be used to solve the problem?
            Is there a solution inherent in the structure itself already?

            e.g. repeated string problem
            https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/repeated-string/problem?h_l=interview&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=interview-preparation-kit&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=warmup

        1. Can you rearrange the data in to a structure more suitable for the problem?

            e.g. SockMerchant.txt
            https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/sock-merchant/problem?h_l=interview&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=interview-preparation-kit&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=warmup

    Path Problems:
        Path finding
        Counting "events/things" in a path

        2. Walk the problem space while simultaneously solving the problem
            as opposed to mapping out the whole problem space(i.e. the path) then solving the problem
            e.g. 
            JumpingOnTheClouds.txt
            https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/jumping-on-the-clouds/problem?h_l=interview&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=interview-preparation-kit&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=warmup

            CountingValleys.txt
            https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/counting-valleys/problem?h_l=interview&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=interview-preparation-kit&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=warmup
        
        3.  Compute the final state without walking the whole path step by step
            i.e. Avoid O(N) implementation
            If the final state factor is defined(e.g. number of rotations)

            e.g. rotate_left.scala 
            
            https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-array-left-rotation/copy-from/75481377?h_l=interview&playlist_slugs%5B%5D%5B%5D=interview-preparation-kit&playlist_slugs%5B%5D%5B%5D=arrays&isFullScreen=true

        4. Given a jumbled state and an original state
        
            Q: How many operations did it take to get to jumbled state?
            A: Reverse to initial state and count operations required to rollback

            e.g. NewYearChaos.scala

        5. many decision points => 
            problem wording = generate, print all possibilities
            exhaust a search space

            tool = backtrack

        6. determining if object A is in group B (Mcdowell, 2015):
            We do NOT always need to generate the entire group B (This could be a big list)
            Can also determine if the rules that generate object A are a subset of the rules that generate group B

    Unique Data Structure Members:
        objective: define generic algorithm to determine if members of a data structure are ALL unique.

        1. create empty seen_hashtable
        2. for member in collection #this traversal depends on the data structure, i.e. array, tree etc
                if member in seen_hashtable: False
                else: add member to seen_hashtable


        """
            Performance
            def:
                N = number of elements in data structure
                
                time = O(N)
                memory = O(N)
        """
