Example⁴:
    motel = [0000000000010000]
    hotel = [0000000100000000]
    vocabulary = [0000000100010000] = motel + hotel
limitations:
    vector_size = O(size of vocabulary)
        Example: 
            given language with 500000 words
            vector_size = 500000
        human language effectively infinite, due to derivational morphology.
    
    no natural notion of similarity
        hotel not equal motel, because they are different(discrete) entities
        hotel not similar to motel in discrete representation.  
            solution: 
                1. similarity matrix
                    limitation: large size 
                2. use NLTK Worndet
                    limitation: incomplete
