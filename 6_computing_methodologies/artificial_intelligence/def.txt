subsets (Kepner, Gadepally, 2020)
  - Narrow AI: Theory and develOpment of computing systems that perform tasks that augment for human intelligence such perception, classification, reasoning, learning, abstracting and/or acting etc.
  - General AI: Theory and develOpment of fully autonomous co  ting systems.

constraints:
  - compute
  - data
  - generalizable knowledge and ability to encode it into algorithm
