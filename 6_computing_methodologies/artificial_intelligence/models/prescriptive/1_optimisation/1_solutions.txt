- Brute force: 
    - enumerate all possible combinations of items(subsets)
        i.e. the powerset 
                this includes the empty set
        - remove all subsets whose total cost exceeds the allowed cost(S(i.e the CONSTRAINT(s))
        - from the remaining subsets, choose anyone whose value is the largest/smallest(depending on opitimization goal(minimize/maximize))
            - can have draws, return anyone.

    - Complexity = Exponential
        S = possibel states for an item
        N = Number of items
        Complexity: O(Sᴺ)

    - Are there other solutions with lower asymptotic complexity? 
        No, we need to generate all possible combinations to find the best combination.

    NB: Many optmization problems are inherently exponential in the number of combinations of items.
        There exists NO algorithm with less than exponential asymptotic complexity.

- Practical alternatives based on the brute force(NOT PERFECT solutions => one of strategies to deal with computationally hard problems):
    - greedy algorithm: 
        while knapsack is not full
            put "best" available item into the knapsack
        what does "best" mean?
            defined specific for problem you are solving
                cheapest, most expensive, toughest, shortest, longest etc

        - Examples: Restuarant Meal
            Menu
                Food                               |wine | beer | pizza |burger |fries |coke |apple |donut |
                Value(How much you value this food)|89   |90    |30     |50     |50    |79   |90    |10    |
                Calories                           |123  |154   |258    |354    |365   |150  |95    |195   |

            Given:
                a menu of food
                your value for each food type

            Objective: choose which food you want to eat
                objective function: foods with the highest total value
            Contraints:
                maximum 750 calories
            
            See: restuarant.py and restuarant_test.py for implementation details

        - Pros:
            - Easy to implement
            - Computationally efficient = O(NlogN)

        - Cons/Limititations:
            - gives an answer which may/may not be the maximum/minimum value we can get.
                And it does not provide how close to the optimal solution it is (THERE SOME THAT DO, BUT ARE SOPHISTICATED)
            NB: makes a sequence of local optimisations,
                which does NOT necessarily add up to a globally optimal answer.
                i.e. it chooses the best solution at the specific point IT IS AT in the dataset 
                        AND NOT the best solution for the whole dataset.
        
    - Brute Force 
        using Search Tree
            Example Tree:
                                                       root
        consequenece of taking current element {take} /   \{don't take} consequenece of not taking the current element
            NB: convention: left = take, right = don't take

        Complexity = 
            Time = number of nodes we generate
                number of levels in tree = number of items
                        each level represents a choice to take or not take an item.
        
                number of nodes per level = 2ⁱ, i >= 0, i = level index

                number of nodes in tree =   i=n
                                            ∑ 2ⁱ
                                            i=0
                    ∴ 2ⁿ⁺¹ 
                    ∴ O(2ⁿ)                                            
        Memoisation
            optimal substrucuture
            overlapping subproblems

            do we have the same items left consider and available weight in knapsack at more than 1 node? 
                if yes, then that is a "memoisable" problem
