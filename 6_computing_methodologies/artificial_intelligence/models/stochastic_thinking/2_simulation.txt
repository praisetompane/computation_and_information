def simulation:
    refer to 0_models/descriptive/simulation

    1. Run large sample size depending on the rarity of the event
    2. Be explicit that the result is a sampled probability
    3. No need to run simulations, if the probability can be computed analytically(in a closed form solution)
        e.g. probability of '11111' from 5 consecutive dice rolls = 1/6^5
                i.e. 
                        6 possible value = *, **, ***, ****, *****, ******
                        5 rolls
                        1 => at least one 5 consecutive dice roll returning 11111
