Sampling:
    perfect accuracy NOT guaranteed.
    differentiate:
        - what happens to be true
                    from
        - what we know is true(through rigor/good reason)

    Core Computational Statistics Question:
        How many samples do we need to look at
            to have justifiable confidence in the answer?
            
            - Depends on: 
                variability of possibilities in the data
                    
                    Quantity variability
                        X = list of possible possibilities
                        μ = Mean of X
                    
                        variance(X) = ΣₓₑX (x - μ)² 
                                     ---------------
                                           |X|

                                    English: sum of 
                                                how far from the mean
                                                    each possibilty(xₑX) is
                                                    i.e. How different from the mean is each value?
                                             squared
                                             divided by number of elements
                                    
                                    Why sqaure?
                                        Do not care if distance negative/positive
                                        Distincly highlights the outliers

                                    Why divide by |X|?
                                        We don't want to say
                                            X has high variance
                                                because it has large population.
                                        i.e. normalises by number of members

                        Standard deviation = σ(X) = sqrt(variance(X))
                                                  = sqrt(
                                                           1  
                                                          --- Σ(x - μ)² 
                                                          |X|ₓₑX      
                                                        )

                                i.e squareroot of variance(X)
                            English: By what value are the members(looked as a whole) different from the Mean.
                                     i.e. By how much do they "deviate" from the Mean

                            MUST always be thought in context of Mean
                            Example: 
                                standard deviation = 100 => meanignless
                                standard deviation = 100 and Mean = 100 => standard deviation is large
                                standard deviation = 100 and Mean = 1000000000 => standard deviation is small
