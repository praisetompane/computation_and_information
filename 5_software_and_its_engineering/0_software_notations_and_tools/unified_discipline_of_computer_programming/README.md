# What is Computer Programming?

**objectives(Van Roy, Haridi S. 2004:xiii)**:

- attempts to define computer programming as a unified discipline using programming concepts and techniques independent of programming language implementations.

- def programming concepts (Van Roy, Haridi S. 2004:xiii):

  - these are organized in terms of/in relation to computation models:

    - def computation model: formal system, that defines how computations are done (Van Roy, Haridi S. 2004:xiii):

      - based on a simple core language called its kernel language (Van Roy, Haridi S. 2004:xiv)

        - def kernel language: TBD

      - defined in terms of (Van Roy, Haridi S. 2004:xiii):

        - data types
        - operations
        - a programming language

        **NB** there are other ways to define computation models: - finite automata (Sipser, 2012:xvii)

      - provides:
        - a programming model:
          - def programming model: a set of programming techniques and design principles
            used to write programs
            in the language of the computation model (Van Roy, Haridi S. 2004:29).
            - def programming techniques: TBD
            - def design principles: TBD
        - set of techniques for:
          - reasoning about programs

**def creative extension principle**: main criterion for when and which concept to add to a computation mode/kernel language (Van Roy, Haridi S. 2004:xiv)

**def computer programming**: the act of extending or
changing a system's functionality (Van Roy, Haridi S. 2004:xv).

  - practitioners:

    - general users: by changing the setting of an alarm
    - expert users: by writing new features for the system or updating existing

  - example:

    - extending a system's functionality:

      - writing a new application for iOS

    - changing a system's functionality:
      - moving iOS from using 4 digits to 7 digits passwords

def technology:

def λ calculus:

def abstractions:
