# What is Computer Programming
objectives:  
* attempts to define computer programming as a unified discipline.
* a study of computer programming independent of programming languages.

def computer programming: the act of extending or
                    changing a system's functionality (Van Roy, Haridi S. 2004:xv).

performed by general users and experts
   general users by changing the setting of an alarm
   expert users by writing new features for the system or updating existing

example:
* extending a system's functionality:
   * writing a new application for iOS

* changing a system's functionality:
   * moving iOS from using 4 digits to 7 digits passwords

def computation model: formal system, that defines how computations are done.
                            computation model provides a programming model.

def programming model: programming techniques AND design principles,
                            made possible AND used by a computation model
