def domain drive design:
    - formal: 
        let:
          A = discrete concepts in problem space.
        then:
          { x : x in A}

        - in words: an architectural pattern, in which a problem space is modelled as a set of bounded context.
                    each bounded context:
                      - represents a discrete concept in the problem space.
                      - exposes an API for interacting with objects of that concept.


    - plain english: ???

    - intuition: ???

    - properties: 
      - benefits: 
        - compliance with Single Responsibility and Separation of Concerns Principle

    - examples: 
      - trading platform:
        - bounded contexts = { user, security, trade }
        - microservices = { app_user, app_security, app_trade}
          - app_user:
            - create_user
            - deactivate_user
            - retrieve_user
            - update_user
            - authenticate_user
          - app_security:
            - create_security
            - retrieve_security
            - update_security
          - app_trade:
            - create_trade
      - 

    - use cases:
      - conceptual design for a microservices architecture.
      - ...
        
    - proof: None. It is definition.
