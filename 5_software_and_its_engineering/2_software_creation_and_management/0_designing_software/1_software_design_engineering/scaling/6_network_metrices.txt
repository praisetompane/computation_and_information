def: bandwidth: the maximum amount of data that can be transferred in a unit of time.
    expressed in bit/s := bit per second

def: throughput: the maximum data that is transferred a unit of time.
                    the actual amount of data transferred in unit of time.

def: latency: the amount of time it takes data to go from one end to another.

            practical example:
                amount of time it takes data
                    for a request from a client node
                    to reach a server node

            latency = request_time - request_reception_time    

practical example:
    given:
        10m cable
        10 bits width cable := 10 bits cab be on the cable concurrently(i.e. at the same time).
        takes 7 seconds to get from start to end of cable
        7 bits reach the end of after latency in reality(perhaps due to resistance, inefficient implementation, broken cable ...)
    then
        bandwidth  := 10 bits per latency
                      10 bits per 7 seconds
        latency    := 7 seconds
        throughput := 7 bits per latency
                      7 bits per 7 seconds
