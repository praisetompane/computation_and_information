      THE NARRATIVES
Chapter 1:
Chapter 2:
Chapter 3: Mapping to relational databases

  The Structural problem:
    -> How do you relate tables to objects

  The behavioural problem
    -> Getting objects to load and save themselves to the database (and keeping the
    data consistent)

    Options:
      Active Record(160)
      Unit of Work(184)
      Identity Map(195)
      Lazy Load(200)

  Reading In Data

  Structural Mapping Patterns

Chapter 4

  View Patterns
    Template View vs Transform View

    One Stage vs Two Step View

  Input Controller Patterns
    Page Controller vs Front Controller


Chapter 5 : Concurrency

  General solution: concurrency controls

  Two basic concurrency problems:
    Lost updates
    Inconsistent read: read data is correct only at a specific time

  Execution contexts

  Possible solutions (in the enterprise application space)
    -> Isolation
    -> Immutability
    -> Transactions


    -> Immutability
      What if we can't have shared data that we can't ISOLATE?
        Proposed solution: Opportunistic and Pessimistic Concurrency control


        Issues with the proposed solutions

          Pessimistic Concurrency control
            1. Deadlocks : Sol: Timeouts and Detection


   -> Transactions
    ACID
    Business Transactions
    System Transactions

    Concurrency control where data spans multiple transaction systems
        Offline concurrency

Chapter 6: Session state

  Patterns for dealing with session state
    Client Session State
    Server Session State
    Database Session state

Chapter 7: Distribution strategies
  CORBA

Chapter 8: Putting it all together

  Step 1: Which domain logic approach?: Transaction Script, Table Module, Domain Model
  Step 2: Connection to database: Row Data Gateway, Table Data Gateway, Active Record
  Step 3: Presentation
          3.1 Structure: MVC
          3.2 Controller: Page Controller and Front Controller
          3.3 View: Template View and Transform View
