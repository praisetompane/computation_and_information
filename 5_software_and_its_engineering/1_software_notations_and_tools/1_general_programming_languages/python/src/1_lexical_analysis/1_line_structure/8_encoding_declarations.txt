def encoding declarations (Python Software Foundation, 2023):
    - informs Python the encoding scheme of the file.
    - properties:
        - must be in the first two lines.
        - if second of the two, the preceding MUST be a comment.
        - provided encoding must be Python supported:
            supported list: https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings
        - declaration must match this regex: coding[=:]\s*([-\w.]+)
        - defaults to UTF-8
    - the encoding is used for all lexical analysis.
    - recommended:
        # -*- coding: <encoding-name> -*-
