def logical line (Python Software Foundation, 2023):
    denoted by NEWLINE(\n) token.
    constructed from one or more physical lines
        following explicit and implicit line joining rules.
    statements do not cross logical lines.
        exceptions = {if the statement's syntax allows NEWLINEs}
            e.g. compound statement: if..else
