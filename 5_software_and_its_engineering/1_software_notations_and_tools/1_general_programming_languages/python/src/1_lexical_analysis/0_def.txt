Python programs are read by a parser (Python Software Foundation, 2023).
    - the parser accepts a stream of tokens as input.

Python program text is read as Unicode code points (Python Software Foundation, 2023).
    - SyntaxError is raised if file cannot be decoded.

Lexical analyzer: generates stream of tokens from Python program text (Python Software Foundation, 2023)
    for the parser.
