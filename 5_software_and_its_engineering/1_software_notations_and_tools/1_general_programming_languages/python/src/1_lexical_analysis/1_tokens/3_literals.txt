def literals (Python Software Foundation, 2023):
    notation
        for constant values
    of some built-in types.

categories (Python Software Foundation, 2023):
    - string and byte literals:
        - string:
            - formatted string literal
        - bytes
    - numeric literals:
        - integer literals
        - floating-point literals
        - imaginary literals

        NB: complex literals DO NOT exist:
            - you manually combine real and imaginary literals to build them.

    - string and byte literals:
        - string:
            properties:
                - prefix: "r" | "u" | "R" | "U" | "f" | "F"
                    | "fr" | "Fr" | "fR" | "FR" | "rf" | "rF" | "Rf" | "RF"

                - valid characters (AKA source characters) are defined from encoding declaration(UTF-8 default).
                - produces an instance of 𝑠𝑡𝑟 type.
                    𝑠𝑡𝑟 details: https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/stdtypes.html#str

            - formatted string literal:
                properties:
                    - prefix: "f" | "F".
                    - may contain replacement fields marked by {}.  
                        - these can contain variables and expressions
                        - are treated as expressions evaluated at runtime.
                            - evaluated left to right
                            limitations:
                                - cannot be empty.
                                - lambda and assignment require explicit parenthesis.
                                - triple-quote literals cannot have comments.

                    - cannot be used as doc strings.
                    - '\' are illegal in format expressions.
                        workaround: create a separate variable with the '\'.

                    - can be combined with r but NOT 'b' or 'u'
                        i.e. formatted strings literals are possible
                             formatted bytes literals are not possible
                modifiers:
                    - conversion
                    - format spec
                    - =

                    - conversion:
                        - allows selecting which built-in to use for formatting
                            - representation allowed:
                                  function          syntax
                                - str():            !s
                                - repr():           !r
                                - ascii():          !a
                    - format spec
                        - allows manipulating more precisely how values are rendered.
                        - syntax: literal : format_spec

                    - = :
                        - allows including the expression in the output
                        - properties:
                            - includes spaces with the {}.
                            - by default invokes repr() for the expression. can be overriden.

                    - precedence:
                        1. expression evaluation
                        2. conversion
                        2. format spec
                        in code:
                            value = conversion(expression evaluation)
                            type(value).__format__(value, format_spec)

        - bytes:
                - prefix: "b" | "B" | "br" | "Br" | "bR" | "BR" | "rb" | "rB" | "Rb" | "RB"

            properties:
                character set:
                    - only ASCII
                        - overrules encoding declarations and Python UTF-8 default
                    - valid characters (AKA source characters) can ONLY be ASCII
                        - NB: This overrules any encoding declaration.
                - must ALWAYS be prefixed with 'b' or 'B'.
                - produces an instance of 𝑏𝑦𝑡𝑒𝑠 type.
                    𝑏𝑦𝑡𝑒𝑠 details: https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/stdtypes.html#bytes
                - bytes with a numeric value greater than 127
                    MUST be expressed with escapes.
                    Q: Why?
                - Python 3.3 supports the 'rb' prefix for raw bytes
                    synonym to 'br' prefix
            
            examples:
                see:5_software_and_its_engineering/1_software_notations_and_tools/1_general_programming_languages/python/src/5_types_literals_escape_sequences.py

        - universal properties:
            - no space allowed between the prefix and the rest of the literal
            - '\' used to escape special characters
                - follows rules similar to Standard C:
                    - complete set can be found here: https://docs.python.org/3.11/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals
                example: 
                    "\\" = \
                    "\\n" = \n
            - 'r' or 'R' prefix allowed
                means raw strings => they treat '\' as literal character

        - concatenation:
            - adjacent strings in different quotes are concatenated.
            properties:
                - split long strings across physical lines without using '\'
                - defined at syntactic level, implemented at compile time. 
                    NB: runtime concatenation still requires '+'

    - numeric literals:
        - integer literals
        - floating-point literals
        - imaginary literals

        properties:
            - they are unsigned
            - unlimited length [only bound by computer's memory]
            - underscores are excluded when determining literal's value
            - leading zeros for nonzero literals are illegal

        NB: complex literals DO NOT exist:
            - you manually combine real and imaginary literals to build them.
