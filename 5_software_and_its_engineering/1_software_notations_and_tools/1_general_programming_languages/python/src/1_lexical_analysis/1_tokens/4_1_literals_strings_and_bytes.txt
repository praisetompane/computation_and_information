string and byte literals (Python Software Foundation, 2023):
    - universal properties:
        - no space allowed between the prefix and the rest of the literal
        - '\' used to escape special characters
            - follows rules similar to Standard C:
                - complete set can be found here: https://docs.python.org/3.11/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals
            example: 
                "\\" = \
                "\\n" = \n
        - 'r' or 'R' prefix allowed
            means raw strings => they treat '\' as literal character

    - concatenation:
        - adjacent strings in different quotes are concatenated.
        - properties:
            - split long strings across physical lines without using '\'
            - defined at syntactic level, implemented at compile time. 
                NB: runtime concatenation still requires '+'
