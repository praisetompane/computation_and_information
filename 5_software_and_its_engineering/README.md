# What is Software?

objective: unpack in layman's terms what computer programming, software and software engineering are and their role in the current implementation of computation.

def¹ software: a term to differentiate the computer 
                                from the state of the bits in the computer (Scott, 2009:109).
              
def² software: state of the bits.
**NB**: the bit itself is hardware.

def³ software (Scott, 2009:109): a package of computer Instruction Code. <br>
