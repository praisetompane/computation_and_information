elementary computer:
    example: Charles Babbage' Analytical Engine
    components:
        - expandable memory?
        - an arithmetic unit
        - logic processing capabilities able to interpret a programming language with loops and conditional branching

    Von Neumann architecture
        idea: computer instructions and data can share memory space.
         - Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
        - Instruction Processing Unit (IPU)
        - Memory  

Boolean Algebra allows modelling computational processes mathematically
